# Booking.com Clone

This project is a clone of the popular travel and accommodation website, Booking.com. The goal of this project is to replicate the functionality and design of Booking.com as closely as possible, providing a similar user experience.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using a modern tech stack for optimal performance and developer experience:

- **Next.js**: A popular React framework that enables features such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language, increasing code quality and understandability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **Shadcn**: A UI component library that was used to speed up the development process.

## Data Collection

Data for this project is scraped from the actual Booking.com website using the trial version of Oxylabs, a premium proxy service provider. This ensures that the data used in this project is as accurate and up-to-date as possible.

## Limitations

Due to the limitations of the hosting platform, Vercel, the search functionality does not work in the live version of the project. Vercel limits the execution time of serverless functions to 10 seconds, which is not enough time to perform a search and return the results. We're actively looking for a solution to this issue.
